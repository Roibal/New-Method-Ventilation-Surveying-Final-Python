"""
The purpose of this program is to collect and record sensor input from Raspberry pi Sense HAT. Data is stored in a Microsoft Excel compatible
csv format file. Recording frequency can be adjusted. Units are in metric.
Further improvements will include the calculation of specific weight of air for Ventilation Engineering in Underground Mining.

Latest Modification: November 2016
Description of Modification: Added Data Collection Module which will record in a csv file
Each Raspberry Pi Module should have 3 digit code which will be used to Identify itself, can be added to Raspberry Pi Library
