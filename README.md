# New Method of Ventilation Surveying Data Collection and Analysis in Underground Mining

The purpose of this github repository is to post Geotechnical/Mining Engineering related python scripts written in Python 3.3. Code was created during Master's Degree research by Joaquin Roibal at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, 2014-2016 and is for research/academic purposes only. All code licensed under MIT License, must provide attribution for any further derivative works.

Primary Focus is development of a ventilation engineering software program for the mining industry, to automate the process of ventilation surveys utilizing Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT to record and analyze temperature, pressure and humidity values.
