"Meas_Test.csv" is formatted data recorded with raspberry pi sensehat for 4 days in a laboratory setting, "Meas_Test2.csv" is a similarly formatted collection of data from 10/15/2016-10/20/2016 in Socorro, NM

**Python Scripts for Displaying Data**

"Raspberry_Pi_data_display.py" will create a chart of variables collected with a sensehat, example is using Meas_Test.csv to visualize data, Includes Raspberry_Pi_data_Display2 & 3, which graph the data from Meas_Test2 and Meas_Test1, and 2 together.
